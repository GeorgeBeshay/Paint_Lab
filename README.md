## <p align = "center"> [Live Preview]() for the application interface </p>
* Please notice that the application is available only as an interface, in other words the application is not active, you can't draw shapes, redo or undo this is due to the absence of a backend server host.
* If you are interested and would like to gain the application experience, you can download the application source code and run the backend server on your local device and run the front end server using the command line, then go to 'localhost:4200/', Enjoy !!
